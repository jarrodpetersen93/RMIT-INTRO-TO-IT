      <p>My interest in IT is very broad and started a long time ago. Unfortunately, I never studied IT outside of high school until this course. </p>
      <p>My motivation to get back into learning IT is for a business idea I would like to put into fruition but need to learn web development. To start my business, I will need to have a solid UI/UX in order to obtain stakeholder interest in joining the platform. To be feasible, it would also need advanced back-end processes. By studying IT I am hoping to be able to better communicate with developers.</p>
      <p>My interest in IT started when I was connecting to my grandparent’s dial-up & wanted to know what the dial-tone was, shortly after I got my first computer & started fiddling with the settings & downloading all manner of programs. I have very little experience in IT outside of work placement from high school which put me off joining the industry.</p>
      <p>I was recommended this course by an OUA student advisor & was told I would get a good idea of what it would be like to work in IT and a better idea of the opportunities there are in different aspects of IT.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">My Ideal IT Job</h1>
      <p>My ideal job in IT would be something like the above, where my experience in insurance will help me to understand insurance providers requirements & better communicate with stakeholders.
        <p>The requirements of this job include a good amount of experience in software development and project management & would require excellent communication skills to liaise between the developers and the business to clearly present the ideas & goals of a project.</p>
        I do not have any of the IT skills or knowledge required for this role & I believe it would require a significant amount of industry experience post-graduation to excel in role of this nature.
        While this may be my idea of a perfect job I don’t have any intention of pursuing it, instead I plan on learning programming to start my own business in the insurance industry within the next couple of years.
        I plan on using as many online resources as are available to me to learn CSS, Javascript & python.

          <div class="w3-twothird w3-container"><img src="images/creativity-test.PNG">
          <p>Reading the results of my creativity test tells me I lack creativity & am below average in all ‘metrics of creativity’. I believe this means I may have trouble contributing, or raising points in a group setting & may will struggle to develop or communicate my own ideas.</p>
            <p>This means I am more likely to sit back in a group setting and simply complete my portion of the work and not take charge. In my ideal team there would specifically need to be a strong leadership type & others who may have more creative ideas.
            </p>
            <h3 class="w3-text-teal w3-padding-16">Learning Style Test</h3>
            <p><a href="Learning-Style.pdf">Click here for the full learning test results</a></p>
            <p>
              My learning styles results, pretty well already cement what I had thought about my learning style. I tend to learn best when watching videos & putting what I’m learning into practice at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t believe this will affect my group work greatly, however I will take into consideration that when possible I should try to communicate with my teammates orally.

              <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
                <div class="w3-twothird">
                    <p>This test showed me that I should take time thinking about things in a deeper manner and trying to understand how & why they work.</p>
                    <p>I’m not sure how this would affect my group work, but if I were to form a team I would need to consider including a leader that is less introverted than myself.</p>
